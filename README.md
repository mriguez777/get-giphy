# Getting-Giphy-with-it

To get started, enter in a topic to search and then click the "Search" button

The search will then query the Giphy API and provide 3 results back with Giph Image and Title(if available).
 
 There are already pre-defined searches listed as buttons on the top of the page. For every search you conduct a button will be created so you know what has been searched for. 

 **The next step of functionality is to display giphs from the buttons created. For timesake I am still working on that functionality.
